First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2015

Name: Jeremy Fox

Date started: January 9, 2014

Date finished: January 16, 2014

Hours worked: About 30

Resources used: I used a lot of Stack Exchange, along with reading the Oracle Docs for JavaFX. I also talked to the TAs, who were very helpful.

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: There is a folder of images that are used in the game.

How to play the game: The object is to avoid the enemies long enough to get to the Earth. You can do this by moving around on screen, or shooting the enemies down as they come toward you. Once you get to the Earth, you win.

Keys/Mouse input: Move left and right with the arrow keys, 

Cheat Keys: Press Shift to toggle invincibility on and off. Press tab to clear all enemies on the screen.

Known bugs: Zero

Extra features: There is a score count that increases every time an enemy is killed. Bread clears the screen of all enemies.

Impressions/Suggestions: The coolest part about this game is the algorithm for the Advanced Enemies that appear in level two, which allows them to follow the player while normalizing their speed. If I had more time, I would coordinate the Advanced Enemies to move and deploy in swarms.
